Upcoming functionality
----------------------

The following functionality is planned for future releases of LibTPT.  The
version numbers may change.

Accelerate releases - Ongoing
	Some corporate users have requested that the interval between non-beta
	releases be reduced so they may use new features in their commercial
	software.  This is because management has an aversion to using products
	that use the term "beta".  To accommodate these users, there will be more
	intermediate production releases with fewer new features added.

optimizations - Ongoing
	There is always room for improved speed and memory usage.  Optimization of
	existing TPT will be ongoing.

@using(library) - Version 1.x
	Loads the specified library.a or library.dll and autoloads all TPT
	callbacks in the library. (Win32 - LoadLibrary, FreeLibrary,
	GetProcAddress) (Unix - dlopen, dlclose, dlsym)

Stream class for formatting text - Version 1.x
	This class will be inserted between the Parser and the user's output
	stream, formatting text as it is output.

Indent ignore when:
	- An open or close brace is the first thing on the line.
	- @if is the first think on a line.
	- A comment is the only thing on a line.

@tpt_wraptext(x) - Version 1.x
	Tells TPT to ignore carriage returns (\n) and wrap text at the specified
	width.  Use a blank line to force a carriage return.  0 means text wrapping
	is off.  The default is 0.

@tpt_settabstop(x) - Version 1.x
	Tells LibTPT how many spaces are in a tab.  For use with
	@tpt_ignoreindentcount(x).  1<=x<=8.  The default is 8 spaces.

@tpt_tabtospace - Version 1.x
	Converts all tab characters (\t) to spaces.  Use @tpt_settabstop(x) to
	determine the number of spaces in a tab.
	
@tpt_ignoreindentcount(x) - Version 1.x
	Tells TPT to ignore the first x tabs on a line.  LibTPT will count either a
	tab character (\t) or the number of spaces specified by @tpt_settabstop(x)
	as one indent.  0 means indent is not ignored.  The default is 0.
	@tpt_ignoreindentcount(x) and @tpt_ignoreindent are mutually exclusive.

${string(index)} - Version 2.x
	Allow direct access to a character at a string index instead of requiring
	the use of @substr..

${x="string"}, ${x=<expr>}, ${x++} - 2.x
	Allow easier assignment of a variable.

@tpt_echovariable(0|1) - 2.x
	Specify whether variable assignments (${x=<expr>}) will be echoed.  0=no,
	1=yes.

Overhaul error reporting - 2.x
	Error reporting is farely inconsistent.  Error codes and error
	classification are needed.

Upcoming functionality
----------------------

The following functionality is planned for future releases of LibTPT.  The
version numbers may change.

optimizations - Ongoing
	There is always room for improved speed.  Optimization of existing TPT will
	be ongoing.

Add IParse - Version 1.2
	Interactive Parse class that allows the Symbols table to be updated.

@includeraw(filename) - Version 1.2
	Includes a raw text file.

@tpt_settabstop(x) - Version 1.2
	Tells LibTPT how many spaces are in a tab.  For use with
	@tpt_ignoreindentcount(x).  1<=x<=8.  The default is 8 spaces.

@tpt_ignoreindentcount(x) - Version 1.2
	Tells TPT to ignore the first x tabs on a line.  LibTPT will count either a
	tab character (\t) or the number of spaces specified by @tpt_settabstop(x)
	as one indent.  0 means indent is not ignored.  The default is 0.
	@tpt_ignoreindentcount(x) and @tpt_ignoreindent are mutually exclusive.

@tpt_tabtospace - Version 1.2
	Converts all tab characters (\t) to spaces.  Use @tpt_settabstop(x) to
	determine the number of spaces in a tab.

Optimization - Version 1.x
	Allow user symbol table to be passed in by pointer, specifying that user copy
	should be used instead of making a full copy.

@tpt_wraptext(x) - Version 1.3
	Tells TPT to ignore carriage returns (\n) and wrap text at the specified
	width.  Use a blank line to force a carriage return.  0 means text wrapping
	is off.  The default is 0.

@tpt_use(library) - Version 2.0
	Loads the specified library.a or library.dll and autoloads all TPT
	callbacks in the library.

${string(index)} - Version 2.x
	Allow direct access to a string index.

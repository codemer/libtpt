Upcoming functionality
----------------------

The following functionality is planned for future releases of LibTPT.  The
version numbers may change.

optimizations - Ongoing
	There is always room for improved speed.  Optimization of existing TPT will
	be ongoing.

@tpt_ignoreindentcount(x) - Version 1.3
	Tells TPT to ignore the first x tabs on a line.  LibTPT will count either a
	tab character (\t) or the number of spaces specified by @tpt_settabstop(x)
	as one indent.  0 means indent is not ignored.  The default is 0.
	@tpt_ignoreindentcount(x) and @tpt_ignoreindent are mutually exclusive.

@tpt_settabstop(x) - Version 1.4
	Tells LibTPT how many spaces are in a tab.  For use with
	@tpt_ignoreindentcount(x).  1<=x<=8.  The default is 8 spaces.

@tpt_tabtospace - Version 1.4
	Converts all tab characters (\t) to spaces.  Use @tpt_settabstop(x) to
	determine the number of spaces in a tab.

@tpt_wraptext(x) - Version 1.5
	Tells TPT to ignore carriage returns (\n) and wrap text at the specified
	width.  Use a blank line to force a carriage return.  0 means text wrapping
	is off.  The default is 0.

@tpt_use(library) - Version 2.0
	Loads the specified library.a or library.dll and autoloads all TPT
	callbacks in the library.

${string(index)} - Version 2.x
	Allow direct access to a string index.

${x="string}, ${x=<expr>}, ${x++} - 2.x
	Allow easier assignment of a variable.

@tpt_echovariable(0|1) - 2.x
	Specify whether variable assignments (${x=<expr>}) will be echoed.  0=no,
	1=yes.

Overhaul error reporting - 2.x

Results from the "bench" benchmark program.  Lower numbers are better.  Test
system is a PIII 866MHz running on FreeBSD compiled with GCC 3.x.

Version 1.12 - ~66.7
	Stopped using ChrSet<> template.

Version 1.11 - ~68.6
	This version removes the private implementation of Buffer, which was
	causing a little extra overhead on accessing the template source.

Version 1.10 - 68.8
	This is the first version of LibTPT tested with the new benchmark program.
